# VersionHook QuickDeploy App
A PyInstaller-based EXE deployer that enables you to quickly and permanently add as many hooks as you desire. It provides user-friendly management of your application's new versions. There's no need to manually modify the application's version. With just one click, the new version of the application is deployed in the CMD. The app is fully customizable.
1. Click on the up or down arrow to increase or decrease the version of the app you wish to deploy, or simply press the Enter button while in the **add/delete a hook entry** or the **version spinbox** to initiate the deployment of the currently selected version.
2. Click on the 'Run CMD' button to open the command line, which is already navigated (cd) to the parent directory (the directory where the `change_version.py` script is located).
