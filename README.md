# VersionHook QuickDeploy App
A PyInstaller-based EXE deployer that enables you to quickly and permanently add as many hooks as you desire. It provides user-friendly management of your application's new versions. There's no need to manually modify the application's version. With just one click, the new version of the application is deployed in the CMD. The app is fully customizable.
1. Click on the up or down arrow to increase or decrease the version of the app you wish to deploy:
